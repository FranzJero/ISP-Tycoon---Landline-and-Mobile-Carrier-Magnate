3. ## Game Mechanics

- ### Realism

    This game has no affiliation nor connection to any real world ISP or other brands.

    Physics, antennas, frequency, and radio field technology are heavily simplified. This is for gameplay purposes. You will not need to have studied any of those subjects above. Still, the basics of it are reflected in the game and need to be respected in planning your network.
    That said, there is still plenty of micromanagement involved.
